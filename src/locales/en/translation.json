Now, I am a student actively learning frontend development and studying modern technologies to turn my passion into a profession.</p> <p>Although I do not yet have commercial experience, I have participated in an educational project where, together with a team, I created a website for the student government of DUKiT. As part of this project, I worked on both the design and its implementation using React. This gave me valuable experience in both frontend and backend development, as well as an opportunity to experience the full process of creating a project from scratch.</p> <p>I am always eager to learn, experiment, and improve my skills so that in the future, I can bring interesting ideas to life at a professional level.</p>",
